  <h1>Navient Solutions LLC Complaints</h1>
  <p>Navient is one of the most well known federal student loan servicers, however many lawsuits have been filed
  against them. These lawsuits go all the way back to 2017, as states complained that Navient failed to act
  in the best interest of their costumers. Over the years, the lawsuits have piled up, yet the repruccsions were small.
  Anyone who recieved false information about their loans did not recieve any sort of compensation. Thousands of complaints
  have been individually filed by each state, and this data is documented in the graphs below. </p>

<p>Based on this data, it can be concluded that a majority of these complaints came from southern states, however larger states typically
had larger numbers of complaints, including states like California, New York, and Texas. Southern schools tend to be on the more expensive side
of the spectrum, so this could be why many more complaints were filed in southern states rather than any other regions.</p>
